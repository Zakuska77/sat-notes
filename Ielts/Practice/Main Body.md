> [!question] 
> Artificial intelligence is now being applied to self-driving cars, thanks to advancements in machine learning and sensor technology. This is a positive development because it can help reduce accidents caused by human errors, such as fatigue or driving under the influence.


The advancement of AI has made automation tasks easier. Since Ai is not hardcoded but is constantly learning without human interference, they can learn from their mistakes. This ensures that it always evolves and becomes more precise with time. For example, when presented diffusion, a type of Ai model to generate images, struggled with the image generation. Nowadays, itâ€™s capable of making small realistic video clips.

### Better version of this paragraph
The development of self-driving cars is driven by advancements in AI, which continuously learns and improves without human intervention. Unlike traditional systems, AI adapts from its mistakes, making it more precise over time. For example, AI in image generation once struggled but now creates realistic videos. Similarly, AI in self-driving cars has evolved to handle complex tasks like navigating traffic and recognizing obstacles, making them safer and more reliable. This continuous learning is why self-driving technology is becoming a practical solution for transportation.
