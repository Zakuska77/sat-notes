# Advanced Math Vocabulary for SAT

## Geometry Terms

- **Congruent** – Figures or angles that are identical in shape and size. For example, congruent triangles have equal angles and sides.
- **Similar Triangles** – Triangles that have the same shape but may differ in size. Their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional.
- **Isosceles Triangle** – A triangle with two sides of equal length and two equal angles opposite those sides.
- **Equilateral Triangle** – A triangle with all three sides and all three angles equal (each angle is 60°).
- **Scalene Triangle** – A triangle with all sides and angles of different lengths and measures.
- **Right Triangle** – A triangle with one 90° angle. In these triangles, the **Pythagorean Theorem** applies (\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)).
- **Altitude** – A perpendicular segment from a vertex of a triangle to the line containing the opposite side. Used to find the height of triangles.
- **Median** – A line segment drawn from a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.
- **Perpendicular Bisector** – A line that divides a segment into two equal parts at a 90° angle.
- **Angle Bisector** – A line that divides an angle into two equal angles.
- **Quadrilateral** – A four-sided polygon, which includes shapes like squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and trapezoids.
- **Parallelogram** – A quadrilateral with opposite sides that are both equal and parallel.
- **Rhombus** – A parallelogram with four equal sides but with opposite angles equal (not necessarily 90°).
- **Trapezoid** – A quadrilateral with only one pair of parallel sides.
- **Transversal** – A line that crosses two or more other lines, creating angles that can be complementary, supplementary, or corresponding.
- **Corresponding Angles** – Angles that are in the same position relative to the two intersected lines and the transversal. They are equal if the two lines are parallel.
- **Alternate Interior Angles** – Angles on opposite sides of a transversal but inside the two lines. They are equal if the lines are parallel.
- **Supplementary Angles** – Two angles whose measures add up to 180°.
- **Complementary Angles** – Two angles whose measures add up to 90°.

## Trigonometry Terms

- **Radians** – An angle measurement unit often used in trigonometry; ($\pi$) radians equals 180°.
- **Unit Circle** – A circle with a radius of 1, centered at the origin of a coordinate plane, used in trigonometry to define sine, cosine, and tangent.
- **Sine, Cosine, Tangent** – Ratios in a right triangle relative to an angle:
    - **Sine (sin)** = opposite/hypotenuse
    - **Cosine (cos)** = adjacent/hypotenuse
    - **Tangent (tan)** = opposite/adjacent
- **Secant, Cosecant, Cotangent** – The reciprocals of sine, cosine, and tangent:
    - **Secant (sec)** = 1/cosine
    - **Cosecant (csc)** = 1/sine
    - **Cotangent (cot)** = 1/tangent

## Algebra Terms

- **Vertex** – A point where two or more lines, edges, or sides meet, like the corners of polygons and polyhedra.
- **Diagonal** – A line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices in a polygon.
- **Polynomial** – An algebraic expression with multiple terms, often in the form \(ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \ldots + k\), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer.
- **Quadratic Equation** – A polynomial equation of degree 2, generally in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
- **Roots or Zeros** – The values of \(x\) that make a polynomial equal to zero. For quadratics, they are found by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.
- **Vertex Form** – A way of expressing a quadratic equation as \(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola.
- **Discriminant** – Part of the quadratic formula (\(b^2 - 4ac\)) that indicates the nature of the roots (real or complex).
- **System of Equations** – A set of equations with multiple variables. Solving a system finds values for the variables that satisfy all equations simultaneously.
- **Matrix** – A rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns, used to solve systems of equations, among other things.
- **Determinant** – A special number calculated from a square matrix, often used in linear algebra to find if a system has a unique solution.
- **Function Notation** – A way to express functions, often written as \(f(x)\) to denote the output of function \(f\) for input \(x\).
- **Domain and Range** – The set of all possible input values (domain) and output values (range) of a function.
