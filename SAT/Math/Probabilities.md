# Probabilities

<span style="background:#affad1">**Favorite outcome </span>/ <span style="background:#ff4d4f">All of possibilities**</span>

### Not Occuring
$P_{\notin occuring} = 1 -P(A)$

### Independent
$P_{()A \cap B)} = 1 -P(A)$

### Dependent events
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap b)}{P(b)}$ => A depends of B

### Possibility of it, is something didn't happened
$P(A of B) = P(A)+P()B)$
