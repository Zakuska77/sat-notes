Let's say we know the side *(s)*  of a equilateral Triangle and we need to find the radius of the circle inside of the triangle. 
${\Large r = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{6}}$

### Equilateral Triangle Height Formula
To find the height in a equilateral triangle you use this function:
$\Large  h= \frac{s\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}$
