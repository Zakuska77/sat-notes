# -ing Words
They are verbs, but not strong enough to be alone

### As a fragment
The fragments (like _"Playing outside"_) add extra information or describe a context.

- **Building toward something**: "Playing outside, the kids were full of energy."
- **Describing context**: "Waiting in line, she looked at her phone."

### As a verb
hrases with . **helping verb** (or **auxiliary verb**) show an ongoing action, and are strong enough to be a standalone verb.

- **Present Continuous**: "She is playing soccer."
- **Past Continuous**: "He was waiting for the bus."
