# Quick Guide: Using Commas with Appositives

An **appositive** is a noun or phrase that adds detail to another noun.
- My brother, **a guitarist**, plays in a band.
- The city, **famous for its culture**, is beautiful.
## When to Use [[Commas(,)]]

Use [[Commas(,)]] with **non-essential** appositives that add extra, non-defining info. If you remove the appositive, the sentence still makes sense.

### Examples:
- My friend **James** is visiting.
- The novel **To Kill a Mockingbird** is a classic.
