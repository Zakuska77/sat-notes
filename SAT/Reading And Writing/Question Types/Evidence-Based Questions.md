### Evidence-Based Questions
On the Reading and Writing section of your SAT, some questions will introduce a claim about an unfamiliar subject. The question will then ask you to identify the piece of evidence that **most strongly supports that claim.**

### **How to Approach Textual Evidence Questions**

There are **two types** of textual evidence questions:

1. **Scientific Evidence** – These involve a **hypothesis** in science or social science, often based on research. You must interpret the hypothesis, determine what research outcome would support it, and select the choice that best aligns. No prior knowledge is needed—everything is in the passage.
2. **Literary Evidence** – These focus on an **argument about a literary work** (e.g., a novel or poem). You must evaluate whether a given quotation directly supports that argument. Again, no prior knowledge of the work is required—only the ability to match the right evidence.

Despite their differences, both require **identifying an argument** and selecting the strongest, most direct supporting evidence.

### **Steps to Solve a Textual Evidence Question**

1. **Identify the Argument** – Find the **main claim** in the passage, whether it’s a research hypothesis or a literary interpretation.
2. **Create a Test Phrase** – Rephrase the argument in **simpler terms** to clarify what you’re looking for.
3. **Test the Choices** – Compare each option against your test phrase. Eliminate choices that introduce **new ideas, broaden the argument, or require extra leaps in logic**.

> [!TIPS]
    > - **Stay Specific** – Avoid choices that blur or extend the argument beyond what’s stated.
    > - **Be Strict** – Choose the strongest, most **direct** evidence. If a choice **"almost"** fits but requires assumptions, eliminate it.
