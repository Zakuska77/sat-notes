They are questions that provide a **short passage** from literature or a scholarly essay. You'll then identify the **main idea** or answer a **specific question** about the text.

> [!NOTE]
    > ###### Correct Answer: **C**
    > Choice C is the best answer because it describes something that is true of Mother, as presented in the text. The text indicates that in addition to other activities, Mother writes stories for her children while they are at school and makes up “funny pieces of poetry” for certain occasions. 

### **How to Approach Central Ideas and Details Questions**  
These questions test **reading comprehension** in a straightforward way—no outside knowledge or deep analysis needed.  
### **Types of Questions**  
1. **Central Ideas** – Identify the **main idea** of the passage. The correct answer should:  
   - Cover most of the passage's details.  
   - Highlight key points of emphasis.  
   - Avoid focusing on just one detail or introducing new ideas.  
2. **Details** – Answer a **specific question** using a sentence from the passage. Look for **keywords** in the question to find the right section of the text.  
### **Steps to Solve**  
1. **Summarize the Text** – Read closely and put the key idea in your own words.  
2. **Determine the Task** – Is it asking for the **main idea** or a **specific detail**?  
3. **Revisit the Text** – Use your summary for main idea questions; for details, find the section referenced in the question.  
4. **Predict and Eliminate** – Guess the answer before looking at choices, then eliminate ones that contradict or add new ideas.  
> [!TIPS]
    > - **Stay specific** – Avoid answers that overgeneralize or change the meaning.
    > - **Keep predictions short** – A concise summary makes choosing the right answer easier.
    > - **Use keywords as a map** – Look for key phrases in the passage to guide you to the correct detail.
