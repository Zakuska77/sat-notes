### Cross-Text Connections
They **present two short texts** and ask you to **compare the authors' points of view.**
![[Pasted image 20250305161155.png]]
> [!NOTE]
    > ###### Correct Answer: **B**
    > Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 states that Ailey had a “deep admiration for jazz music” and that he “helped bring jazz to life for his audiences.” Author 2 states that “Jazz is present throughout Ailey’s work.” While the authors name different aspects of Ailey’s work as the most influenced by jazz, they agree that jazz was a strong influence. 
### **How to Approach Cross-Text Connections Questions**  
These questions ask you to **compare the points of view** in two related texts.  
### **Steps to Solve**  
1. **Summarize Each Text** – Identify the **main idea** and the **author’s point of view** in both passages.  
2. **Determine the Relationship** – Do the authors **agree, disagree, or expand** on each other’s ideas?  
3. **Test the Choices** – Pick the option that **best describes their connection**, avoiding extreme or unsupported claims.  

> [!TIPS]
    > - **Look for tone (+ or -)** – Positive and negative word choices reveal agreement or disagreement. 
    > - **Stick to the text** – Eliminate choices that exaggerate or go beyond what’s stated.
