### Quantitative Evidence
They have a short explanation, and you need to **complete a sentence** using data from the graph or table correctly. These questions present a **graph or table** alongside a short text. Your task is to find the **best data** to support the argument in the text.
##### Exemple: 
![[Pasted image 20250305133524.png]]
> [!NOTE]
    > ###### Correct Answer: **C**
    > Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement. The table shows that on day 1, the menu for NASA’s Gemini missions included sugar cookie cubes for meal B.

### **How to Approach Quantitative Evidence Questions**  

These questions present a **graph or table** alongside a short text. Your task is to find the **best data** to support the argument in the text.  

### **Challenges & Approach**  
1. **Understand the Argument**  
   - The text contains extra details—focus only on the main argument.  
   - The data you choose **must support** this argument.  
2. **Read the Data Carefully**  
   - The graph/table may include **more information than needed**.  
   - Skim the **title, labels, units, and key** to understand what’s shown.  
3. **Evaluate Answer Choices**  
   - **False choices:** Misinterpret or misrepresent data—eliminate them.  
   - **True but irrelevant choices:** They are correct but **don’t support** the argument—eliminate them.  
   - **Correct choice:** The best evidence directly supports the argument.  
### **Steps to Solve**  

1. **Skim the Graph/Table** – Get a general idea of what it contains.  
2. **Read the Paragraph** – Identify the argument and what data to look for.  
3. **Validate the Choices** – Check if they match the data in the graph/table.  
4. **Choose the Best Evidence** – The correct answer directly supports the argument.  

> [!TIPS]
    > - **Use your finger or cursor** – Helps avoid mistakes when reading graphs. 
    > - **Check if choices are true or false** – If one false choice appears, all incorrect ones are likely false. If all choices are true, focus on **which one best supports** the argument.  
    > - **Eliminate extra details** – Stay focused on the specific data that supports the argument.
    > - **Be precise** – The correct choice should **directly** align with the argument, without assumptions.
