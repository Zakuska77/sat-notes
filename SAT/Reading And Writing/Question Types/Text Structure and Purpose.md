### **How to Approach Text Structure and Purpose Questions**  

These questions ask **why** the author wrote the passage (**purpose**) and **how** the ideas are organized (**structure**).  
### **Key Concepts**  
- **Purpose** – The author's goal (e.g., to explain, argue, criticize, introduce).  
- **Structure** – How the text flows and connects ideas (cause-effect, comparison, argument).  
### **Steps to Solve**  
1. **Identify the Task** – Check if the question asks about **purpose** or **structure** and focus on that.
2. **Summarize the Text** – Simplify the passage into 1-2 key points.  
3. **Test the Choices** – Pick the option that best matches the passage’s **goal** or **organization**.  
> [!NOTE]
    > - **Stay specific** – Eliminate choices that add unrelated ideas or miss the main focus.
    > - **Be strict** – If a choice describes only part of the text correctly, eliminate it.
    > - **Be strict** – If a choice describes only part of the text correctly, eliminate it.
    > - **Use transitions** – Words like "however" or "therefore" help reveal the structure.
