##### Exemple

> [!NOTE]
    > ###### Correct Answer: **C**
    > Choice C is the best answer. "Preserving" means "maintaining" or "keeping in good condition," so preserving the photographs means that audiences should be able to view them for a long time.
### **How to Approach Words in Context Questions**  

These questions test your ability to **choose the most precise word** that best fits a passage’s meaning.  
### **Key Factors**  
1. **Context** – Read carefully to find clues in the passage. Words in context often follow a **statement → restatement** pattern, where one part explains the missing word.  
2. **Connotation** – Words can have similar meanings but different tones (**positive vs. negative**). Choose the word that best matches the sentence’s intent.  
### **Steps to Solve**  
1. **Summarize the Text** – Put the main idea in your own words to understand the missing word’s role.  
2. **Find Key Clues** – Look for words or phrases that restate or hint at the correct answer.  
3. **Choose the Best Match** – Eliminate choices that change the meaning, introduce new ideas, or have the wrong connotation.  

> [!NOTE]
    > - **Check connotation** – If the sentence is positive, eliminate negative words (and vice versa).  
    > - **Avoid unknown words** – Don’t pick a word just because it’s unfamiliar. First, eliminate wrong choices based on what you know.
    > - **Stick to the passage** – The right word will **reinforce** the given information, not change it.
