### Inferences
They **present an unfinished passage** on an unfamiliar topic and ask you to **choose the option that best completes the text logically.**

> [!NOTE]
    > ###### Correct Answer: **A**
    > Choice A is the best answer. The text says that handshakes create trust, and that the engineers’ goal is to “improve human-robot interactions.” This suggests that they want the robot’s handshake to feel real because they want humans to trust the robot.
### **How to Approach Inference Questions**  
Inference questions test your ability to **connect ideas and complete an argument** using given information.  
### **Understanding the Argument**  
- **Premises** – Facts that support the argument.  
- **Conclusion** – The main claim the passage is making.  
- Think of these as **clues** leading to the missing piece.  
### **Steps to Solve**  
1. **Break the Passage into Key Points** – Identify the argument's structure and look for gaps.  
2. **Analyze the Argument** – Determine how the ideas connect and what’s missing.  
3. **Evaluate the Choices** – Eliminate options that add unrelated ideas or change the argument.  
4. **Choose the Strongest Option** – The correct choice will **logically complete and strengthen** the argument.  
> [!NOTE]
    > - **Stay specific** – Avoid broad statements like "most" or "many" if the passage is focused on one detail.
    > - **Use transitions** – Words before the blank (e.g., "therefore," "however") hint at what’s missing.  
    > - **Watch punctuation** – Colons, semicolons, and dashes often introduce **explanations or conclusions**.
