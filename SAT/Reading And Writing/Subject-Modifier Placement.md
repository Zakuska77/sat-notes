### Modifier
A **modifier** is a word, phrase, or clause that provides additional information about another word in the sentence, often the **subject**.

### Dangling Modifiers
A <font color="#c00000">dangling modifier</font> occurs when a descriptive phrase is not clearly and logically attached to the word it is meant to modify.
1. Example: After walking for hours, the park finally appeared.
2. Correction: After walking for hours, they finally saw the park.
### Correct Subject-Modifier Placement
1. Identify the Modifier and the Subject
2. Check for Clarity
3. Avoid Ambiguity
