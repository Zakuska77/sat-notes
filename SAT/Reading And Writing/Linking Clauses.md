### Types of Clauses

- **Independent Clause**: A complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence.
    
	Example: "She loves to read."
- **Dependent Clause**: An incomplete thought that cannot stand alone and depends on an independent clause.
    
	Example: "Although she loves to read" (needs an independent clause to make sense, e.g., "Although she loves to read, she doesn’t have much time.")

### Methods for Linking Clauses

###### Coordinating Conjunctions → [[Commas(,)]]+ FANBOYS
> "She wanted to go to the beach, <span style="background:#9254de">but</span> it started raining."

###### Semicolons → the same as a period

> She loves to read; her favorite genre is science fiction.

##### Semicolons with Conjunctive Adverbs → [[Semicolons(;)]]+ [[Linking Words|Conjunctive adverbs]]

> She loves to read; however, she doesn’t have much time.

##### Subordinating Conjunctions → (such as because, although, since, when, while, if, etc.)
Use a comma before the independent clause. No comma is needed when the independent clause comes first.
**Example 1**: Although she loves to read, she doesn’t have much time.
**Example 2**: She doesn’t have much time, although she loves to read.

> [!bug] 
> -A **comma splice** occurs when two independent clauses are linked by a comma without a conjunction. This is incorrect and should be avoided.
