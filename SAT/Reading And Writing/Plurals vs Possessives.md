### How to form plurals and possessives

- **Plural nouns** do not require an apostrophe.
- **Singular possessive nouns** require an apostrophe _followed_ by an "s".
- **Plural possessive nouns that end in "s"** require an apostrophe _after_ the "s".
- **Pronouns** never use apostrophes. His and hers don't use apostrophes. Yours, ours, and theirs are in the same category.

> "Its" and "their" follow the same rule as other possessive pronouns: **they don't require an apostrophe.**
